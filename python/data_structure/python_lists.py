# List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.

squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)

# Stack operations
# Python program to
# demonstrate stack implementation
# using list
 
stack = []
 
# append() function to push
# element in the stack
stack.append('a')
stack.append('b')
stack.append('c')
 
print('Initial stack')
print(stack)
 
# pop() function to pop
# element from stack in
# LIFO order
print('\nElements popped from stack:')
print(stack.pop())
print(stack.pop())
print(stack.pop())
 
print('\nStack after elements are popped:')
print(stack)


# Use list as queues 

from collections import deque
queue = deque(["Eric", "John", "Michael"])
queue.append("Terry")           # Terry arrives
queue.append("Graham")          # Graham arrives
queue.popleft()                 # The first to arrive now leaves

queue.popleft()                 # The second to arrive now leaves

print(queue)                           # Remaining queue in order of arrival
